This is a repo for my writeup on a novel malware sample going under the name fastSMB.  This malware was initially uploaded to github disguised as a tool for brute-forcing SMB credentials/finding known vulnerabilities with SMB.

Additional Info:
I initially discovered this malware after it was shared in a cybersecurity Discord server’s tool-sharing channel.
The uploader included a video from a newly created YouTube channel, claiming they didn’t know how the tool worked but that it had been helpful to them. I found this suspicious because the video was from a new channel, and the idea of someone using an SMB brute-force tool in a professional context seemed highly unlikely.
